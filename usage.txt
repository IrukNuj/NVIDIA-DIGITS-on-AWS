1. Choose instance type depending on training performance needs (e.g. p2.xlarge)
2. Ensure the port xxxx is open (this is already setup if using the default security group settings under 1-Click Launch) 
3. Open a browser and type the public IP address of the instance at port xxxx (e.g. http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx/  ) to get the DIGITS UI
4. Datasets can be mounted under /home/digits/data before using DIGITS to train your neural network
5. Note that "/home/digits/data" and "/home/digits/jobs" have been mounted as "/data" and "/jobs" respectively inside the DIGITS container. If you have mounted your dataset under /home/digits/data, then you should specify "/data" as the "Image Folder" in the DIGITS UI

To install the CUDA Toolkit, open an SSH terminal to the instance and install CUDA using the package manager as shown below:
$ sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-9-0
